The Food Delivery Website is a user-friendly online platform developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and the Django framework with Python.

The integration of the E-sewa payment gateway allows for secure and hassle-free online payments.

Each restaurant has its own menu, featuring various food items along with their descriptions, prices, and images. Customers can browse through the menus to select their desired items.
